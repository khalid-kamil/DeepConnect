# DeepConnect

Whether you're gathering with friends, on a road trip, or simply looking to connect on a deeper level, Deep Connect provides the perfect prompts to inspire thought-provoking discussions.

Deep Connect's questions draw inspiration from the "36 Questions That Lead to Love," a study conducted by psychologist Arthur Aron and his colleagues. The study explored a set of questions designed to foster closeness and intimacy between strangers. While Deep Connect adapts and expands upon this concept, it shares the same foundation of encouraging meaningful connections.

These questions are designed to go beyond surface-level conversation, encouraging participants to share, reflect, and connect on a deeper level. Deep Connect is committed to promoting meaningful interactions, building stronger relationships, and fostering empathy through scientifically informed questions that inspire genuine connection.
